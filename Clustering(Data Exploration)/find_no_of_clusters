/*In the video, you learned how to choose a good number of clusters
for a dataset using the k-means inertia graph. You are given an array 
samples containing the measurements (such as area, perimeter, length, 
and several others) of samples of grain. What's a good number 
of clusters in this case?

KMeans and PyPlot (plt) have already been imported for you.
